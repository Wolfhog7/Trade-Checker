# Trade-Checker
A calculator that checks CoreProtect logs for wrong trades.

## Directions for use:

2. Input the change in items for each row of the CoreProtect log on the left box as either a positive or negative number. Place each new value on a new line.
3. Input the change in currency on the right box using the same format as Step 2.
4. Press the `Calculate` button.

Note: CoreProtect logs are not 100% accurate.
